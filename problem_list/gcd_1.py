## naive implementation lol fcksks
# remainder theorem:
#     dividend (vajjo) = divisor(vajok) * quotient(vagfol) + remainder(vagshes)

# but we can utilize it for basic representation 

# if we need to determine gcd of a and b 
# do if a > b: a = b * a/b + r until c==0 then b is the gcd
# so b is the freaking gcd 
# def gcd(a,b): # logic is
#     if a == 0: return b # if remainder becomes 0 return 
#     return gcd(a%b, a)

# print(gcd(30, 60))
